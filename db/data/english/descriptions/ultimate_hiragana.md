## Ultimate Hiragana

---

**すごい!!** 😱

You are about to take the ultimate hiragana challenge.

As well as **dakuten ( ﾞ)** and **handakuten ( ﾟ)** now we deal with
**ようおん (youon)**

It will be tough, but you can do it!

| Hiragana | Romaji |
| ----------  | ----- |
| ぴょ　-> | pyo |
| しゅ　-> | shu |

etc...

Your goal is to match the hiragana to their romaji, just hit **PLAY** to get started.

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!

がんばって!!!
