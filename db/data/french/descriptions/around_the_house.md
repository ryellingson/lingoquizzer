## Around the house

---

Time to practice your **around the house** vocabulary in French!

Your goal is to match the **icon** to its French **word**.

| Icon | Word | 
| ---- | ---- |
| 👞　->  | la chaussure |
| 👓　->  | les lunettes | 

etc...

Careful about **articles (le, la)** and **accent marks**.

Remember on your keyboard: 
option + e + e = é
option + ` + e = è
option + c = ç
option + i + e = ê
option + u + e = ë
option + q = œ

etc...

Just hit **PLAY** to get started!

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!

Bonne chance!!!
